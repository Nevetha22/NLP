        "The model is trained using a dataset of input sequences and their corresponding target sequences. The model learns to minimize the difference between its predicted outputs and the actual target sequences using a loss function, such as cross-entropy loss. There are some limitations to this method. The code relies on a fixed vocabulary extracted from the training data.Out-of-vocabulary words or rare words may not be handled properly, leading to less accurate or less meaningful text generation.Fine-tuning the generated abstracts with human feedback or additional training data could potentially improve the quality of the generated text."
